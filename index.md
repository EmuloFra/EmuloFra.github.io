This will be the longest project in the portfolio, which is why explanations of basic topics and definitions of well-known tools will be avoided.

Here's what this project aims to do:
- Learn to configure Networks, Firewalls, Servers and Systems;
- Administer Windows and Linux clients and servers;
- Harden devices and networks;
- General PT (tools and techniques);
- Monitor and Defend against attacks.
